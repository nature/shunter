# Support Guide

Shunter major versions are supported for 6 months after their last release, starting from version 3.0. This means that patch-level changes will be added and bugs will be fixed. This guide outlines the end-of-support dates for the various major versions, and the last minor release for that version.

| Major Version | Last Feature Release | Support End Date |
| :------------ | :------------------- | :--------------- |
| 4             | N/A                  | N/A              |
| 3             | 3.8                  | 2017-01-23\*     |
| 2             | 2.2                  | 2015-11-10\*     |
| 1             | 1.0                  | 2015-09-29\*     |

\* Versions 1 and 2 of Shunter never had public releases, and so the support end date was immediate.
