Shunter Migration Guide, 1.0 to 2.0
===================================

This guide outlines how to migrate from Shunter 1.x to Shunter 2.x. It outlines breaking changes which might cause issues when you upgrade.

## Template Testing

The DOM library used in [template testing](../usage/testing.md#testing-templates) has changed from jsdom to [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio). This brings us closer to supporting Node.js 4.x.

The `dom` object that you access in template tests is now a Cheerio instance, and regualar DOM access is no longer available. You may need to update your tests.

One notable change is that the `:first` and `:last` pseudo-selectors are no longer available in `$()` and `.find()` calls. You're encouraged to use the `.first()` and `.last()` methods of a Cheerio instance instead.
