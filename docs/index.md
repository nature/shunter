Welcome to the Shunter documentation. Shunter is a Node.js application built to read JSON and translate it into HTML.

For new users, we recommend reading the [Shunter Introduction](introduction.md) followed by the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md).

If you're looking for the full documentation, refer to the [API Documentation](usage/index.md).

If you're migrating between major versions of Shunter, we maintain a [migration guide](migration/index.md).

If you're interested in contributing to Shunter, we also maintain a [developer guide](developer-guide.md).
