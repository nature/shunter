Welcome to the Shunter documentation. Shunter is a Node.js application built to read JSON and translate it into HTML.

For new users, we recommend reading the [Getting Started Guide](getting-started.md), which will introduce Shunter and show you how to build a basic application.

If you're looking for the full documentation, refer to the [API Documentation](usage/index.md).

If you're looking for support end dates or migrating between major versions of Shunter, we maintain a [support guide](support.md) and a [migration guide](migration/index.md).

If you're interested in contributing to Shunter, we also maintain a [guide for developers](developer-guide.md).
